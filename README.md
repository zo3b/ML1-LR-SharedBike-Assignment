## General Information
**Business Problem:** The goal is to build a predictive model to help bike-sharing companies optimize fleet distribution and improve service availability.
## Conclusions
- Feature Selection Consistency: Both manual (p-value & VIF) and RFE methods selected the same key features, confirming their significance.
- Model Performance: The RÂ² score of 0.784 suggests the model explains 78.4% of the variance in bike demand.
- Key Factors Affecting Demand: Temperature, weather conditions, and working days have the highest impact on rental volume.
- Reliable Predictions: The model effectively predicts bike demand with low error (MSE: 0.0097), making it suitable for real-world application.
